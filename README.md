# CAR RACE GAME
This is the repository to store my final project for University course, Object Oriented Programming.
This is an infinite point collecting car race with a nice menu system and stores all the scores and time for them to display highest three scroes.

This game aims to implement all four pillars of Object Oriented Programming, as well as use built-in File class to store score data.
